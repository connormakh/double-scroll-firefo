# double-scroll-firefox

This repo is for demonstrational purposes, to test an issue showing on Firefox with Mac.
The issue involves having 2 scrollable views in a single page on the popup. One of the views can be normally scrolled through (with the mousewheel), while the other one will only scroll if you manually use the scrollbar.

## Installation - FIREFOX

1. Navigate to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
2. Click `Load Temporary Add-on`
3. Navigate to the cloned repo's manifest.json file, and select it

Open the popup view of the extension, the issue should be reproduced.
